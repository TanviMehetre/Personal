                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself
                    and text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything related to the project itself.</p>
